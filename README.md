# sum-of-the-squares-of-the-first-15-positive-integers
program that computes the sum of the squares of the first 15 positive integers and display the results
Both of these programs calculate the sum of the squares of the first 15 positive integers using either a while or for loop. In each iteration of the loop, the square of the current number is added to the sum. After the loop completes, the final sum is displayed
